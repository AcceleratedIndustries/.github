# 🚀 Accelerated Industries

**AI First. Warehouse Smart.**

We are building the next generation of **AI-driven warehouse and logistics software**.  
Our goal: reduce overhead, streamline operations, and let AI make the routine decisions —  
so humans can focus on what matters.

## 🌟 What We’re Working On
- **Accelerated WMS (Warehouse Management System)**  
  AI-first, lightweight, and designed for SMBs and enterprise alike.
- **HyprSTT**  
  Speech to text for Hyprland and Niri! Fast and locally hosted. 
- **DropSync**  
  A smart file sync and integration service for seamless data flows.
- **AI Tools**  
  Internal projects that power automation, decision support, and voice interfaces.
- **Bifrost Bridge** 
  Bifrost is a handy tool that bridges your Claude Code in the terminal to the Signal app on your phone.  It allows you to answer Claude's permission request and others, via the phone in your pocket.  You're no longer tethered to your workstation.

## 🧩 Core Principles
- **AI First** → All workflows designed with AI as the foundation.  
- **Integration-ready** → Message-based data exchange (MQTT, queues, APIs).  
- **Lightweight Deployments** → Containers, on-prem or cloud, tuned for flexibility.  
- **Food & Logistics Focus** → Systems built to respect freshness, safety, and compliance.
